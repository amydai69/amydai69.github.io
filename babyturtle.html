  <p>A baby turtle can survive on simple food like dried pellets,<br> 
    but if you really want him to thrive, you should always aim <br> 
    for a healthy mix that allows for seasonal availability as well. <br> <br>

  <p>Longer quotation: 
    <blockquote>After 'Divergent,' I got a job rewriting 
      a sci-fi script at Paramount. I think they <br>really liked what I did, so I 
      got a call saying, 'We're about to shoot 'Ninja Turtles' <br>in three or four months; 
      do you wanna come in and do a little work on the script?' <br>That was the beginning 
      of a many-month 'Ninja Turtle' odyssey.</blockquote>
